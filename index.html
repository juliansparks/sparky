          <header class = 'c2head'>THE STORY</header>
          <p class = "infocard2">Everyone knows how fairytales usually go. The
             hero wins and the villain falls. But this isn't the fall of a villain.
              This is a story of his rising and that is where our titular character,
              Julian Sparks comes in.
              <br>On the night Julian was born, a king- an evil king- destroyed
              his entire kingdom, including himself, and sent his son, Lysandre,
              to the land of a group of magical beings called the Artists. The Artists
               were created by the stars to carry on the duties of creating the stories
               we all know and love, and to inspire the world. They were also granted the
               power to breathe life into anything they created. On that same night, the
               stars chose our hero- Err... villain as the new Artist.
               <br>Upon meeting Lysandre, Julian enters his role as the new Evil
                King and the Artist, as he explores how these two destinies can
                go hand-in-hand. As the Evil King, Julian lives in the shadow of
                Bryce White's story. His goal is to destroy Bryce before his timely
                "unhappily ever after" to escape the trap this story has set for him,
                <br>With his Artist powers, Julian created stories full of heroes,
                villains, and adventures. Little did he know that these stories
                would become very real and the characters would gain the ability
                to cross over to the real world through Julian's sketchbook. Since
                then, they took it upon themselves to explore what this new land
                 has in store for them.
                 <br>Now Julian will do whatever it takes to write his own story
                  and get his happy ending once and for all.

          <header class="c3head">THE WORLD</header>
          <p class = "infocard3">
            This world is not unlike ours. People wake up. They go to work/school.
            They have dinner and have fun. The only thing is that they have to deal
            with the fact that fairytales and magic aren't just figments of fantasy.
            This is a world where the gods walked above the humans, where fairies
            flutter their wings in the darkest of forests, and where evil kings
            or queens could rise to power.
            <br>Despite this, the magical side of this world is often hidden away.
            It only took one spark (or a Sparks) to inspire the magical beings
            to come out from the shadows.
            <br>Our story takes place in the sunny and buzzling city of Miami. Like
            the weather, things are about to get unpredictable in this city as
            some of our favorite fairytale villains are turning the pages on their
            stories. As these characters rise and fall, so do new lands. So where can
            Julian Sparks catch a break? Perhaps, in a castle off the dock by the beach.
            And something says this new kingdom will only expand in the next chapter.

            this monarch unstoppable. It also helps that he has the magical ability
             to create anything he wants. Julian will go as far as it takes to get
             what he wants. He may seem distant, but he cares. Coming from a past
             full of ostracization, he holds a resentment towards most humans and
             is willing to take a stand to be his true self. Julian is often torn
             between his role in a fairytale story and his duty to the world,
             constantly trying to pull together shards from two different mirrors. </div>

            world when necessary, even saving the world from Julian’s antics sometimes.
            Jake will go at lengths to see the good in everyone and find the light in
            the darkest of beings. Some may say that his story was the one that initiated

        Braeden tends to rival Jake in their friendships with Julian. Due to his

       Bryce may let his high status and popularity feed him into an inflated ego,
